# React Showcase

Simple project to showcase the storybook tool.

## Getting Started

You can use `npm` to install the dependencies of the project. You can run:

```bash
npm ci
```
to install according to `package-lock.json`. In general, do _not_ `npm install` unless you are specifically looking to make updates down the dependency graph in `package-lock.json`.

## Main Page
